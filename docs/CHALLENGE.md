# Sat Trajectory - ANT61 Satellite Safety System

## üéØ Challenge Summary
Build a system where satellite operators can:
1. Input multiple satellites with orbital parameters
2. Receive real-time notifications of dangerous situations
3. Get suggested actions to minimize damage
4. Execute actions through the interface

## üö® Key Threats to Address

### 1. Conjunction Events
- **Problem**: Satellites coming close to space debris/asteroids
- **Risk**: Collisions that destroy satellites and create debris
- **Solution**: Real-time conjunction detection and avoidance maneuvers

### 2. CME Events (Coronal Mass Ejection)
- **Problem**: Dense particle streams from the Sun
- **Risk**: Destruction of onboard electronics
- **Solution**: Space weather monitoring and protective actions

## üõ†Ô∏è System Components

### Data Integration
- Space-Track.org for conjunction data
- NASA Space Weather Prediction Center
- ESA Space Debris Office
- USSTRATCOM Space Surveillance Network

### Core Features
- Multi-satellite input system
